# ðŸŽ‰ Your GenerateBlocks Workflow Solution!

## What I Discovered:

Your version of GenerateBlocks works differently than older versions:
- Uses `generateblocks/element` instead of `container`
- Background images use CSS variables with escaped characters (`\u002d` = `-`)
- Buttons are text elements with `tagName: "a"`
- Each element needs unique IDs

## Your Automated Workflow:

### Option 1: Use the Component Generator (Easiest!)

1. **Open `component-generator.html`** in your browser
2. Fill in your content and image URLs
3. Click "Generate Code"
4. Copy and paste into WordPress

### Option 2: Use the Template

1. Open `generateblocks-template.txt`
2. Replace:
   - `UNIQUE1` through `UNIQUE10` with random 8-character strings
   - `Your Title Here` with your title
   - `Your description text here` with your description
   - `IMAGE_URL_1` through `IMAGE_URL_4` with your image URLs
3. Paste into WordPress

### Option 3: Create an AI Prompt

Based on your code structure, here's the perfect prompt for AI:

```
Create a GenerateBlocks component using this exact structure:
- Use generateblocks/element blocks (not container)
- Each element needs a unique 8-character ID
- Background images should use CSS variables with \u002d\u002d for dashes
- Include styles and css properties for background images
- Button should be a generateblocks/text element with tagName "a"

Structure:
- furniture-showcase (main wrapper)
  - furniture-showcase__container
    - furniture-showcase__content
      - h2 title
      - paragraph description
      - button (as text element)
    - furniture-showcase__gallery
      - 4 image containers with background images

[Provide the template code as example]
```

## How Daniel's Workflow Actually Works:

Now I understand! Daniel's AI agent:
1. Knows the exact GenerateBlocks format your version uses
2. Generates unique IDs automatically
3. Properly escapes CSS variables
4. Creates the complete block structure

## Your New Workflow:

1. **For Quick Components**: Use the HTML generator tool
2. **For AI Generation**: Use the prompt above with the template
3. **For Manual Creation**: You now know the exact structure needed

## Key Technical Details:

- `\u002d` = Unicode escape for dash (-)
- Each uniqueId must be unique across your site
- Background images use inline CSS variables
- The css property must reference the same uniqueId

This should make creating components MUCH faster than manual building!
