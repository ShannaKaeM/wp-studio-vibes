# Quick Instructions

## Fastest Way to Create New Components:

### 1. Use the Generator Tool
- Open `component-generator.html` in your browser
- Fill in your content
- Add image URLs
- Click "Generate Code"
- Copy â†’ Paste in WordPress

### 2. Copy Your Working Code
- Use `your-working-code.txt` as a base
- Change the unique IDs (any 8 random characters)
- Update text and image URLs
- Paste in WordPress

### 3. What Makes Your GenerateBlocks Special:

Your version uses:
```
generateblocks/element (not container)
CSS variables with \u002d\u002d (escaped dashes)
Inline styles for background images
Unique IDs for each element
```

## Example Unique ID Generator:
Just use any 8 random characters like:
- a1b2c3d4
- xyz12345
- hello123

## The Pattern:
1. Main wrapper â†’ Container â†’ Content (title, text, button)
2. Gallery with 4 image blocks
3. All styled with your CSS classes

That's it! Much easier than manual building! ðŸš€
