# Color Settings

## What This Does

Pick your 5 main colors for your website:
- **Primary**: Your main brand color
- **Secondary**: Your second color
- **Accent**: For buttons and highlights
- **Neutral**: For text and borders
- **Base**: For backgrounds

That's it!

## How It Works

1. You pick a color (like blue)
2. The system makes it work everywhere
3. Presets can make variations automatically

## What Presets Do With Your Colors

When you pick a preset, it takes your colors and creates:
- **Light/Dark versions** for hover effects
- **Transparent versions** for overlays
- **Saturated versions** for emphasis
- **Text hierarchy** (darker for headings, lighter for captions)

You just pick the base colors. The presets do the rest!

## Example

You pick:
- Primary = Blue
- Secondary = Green

A preset might create:
- Hover Blue (darker blue)
- Light Blue (for backgrounds)
- Text Blue (readable on white)
- And more...

Simple!
