# Typography Settings

## What This Does

Set the base typography values that presets will use:
- **Base Font Size**: Your starting size (like 16px)
- **Base Text Color**: Your default text color
- **Font Families**: Your Primary and Secondary font families

That's it! Presets do everything else.

## What You Set

### 1. Base Font Size
Your starting point. Everything else calculates from this.
- Default: 16px
- You can pick: 14px, 16px, 18px, 20px

### 2. Base Text Color  
The default color for all text.
- Uses your neutral color but you can pick any of your colors here in this section. keep in mind that this color is used for all test elements so if you want to make just yoru titles or pretitles pop with primary color for example you can set that up in the presets section.

### 3. Font Families - Default Preset
- **Primary Font**: For titles- or whatever you want to be primary
- **Secondary Font**: For body text- or whatever you want to be secondary

## How It Works

1. You set these base values
2. Presets use them to calculate everything else:
   - All the different sizes - Pretitles, Titles, Subtitles, Body, etc.
   - Line heights
   - Letter spacing
   - Font weights
   - Color variations

## Example

You set: Thes are the defaults and you are welcoem to just leave them and start designing.
- Base Size: 16px
- Text Color: Neutral
- Primary Font: Montserrat
- Secondary Font: Inter

Presets create the whole system from just these! and we have already set up the presets.  Also these choices have defaults so you can literally just star designing witout setting anything., default values are neutral, montserrat, and inter. and base size is 1rem = 16px
