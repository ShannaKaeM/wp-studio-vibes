# Foundation Variables: Colors

## From V2 (VARIABLES-V2.md)

```css
/* ===== THEME COLORS ===== */
This is where we will add a place for the user to add their brand colors. brand1, brand2, brand3 etc..I sort of think we may want to add a client top level as well so Client1 Client2 etc.. and then in each client we can have brand1, brand2, brand3 etc... see notes on the plugin map for more info.
