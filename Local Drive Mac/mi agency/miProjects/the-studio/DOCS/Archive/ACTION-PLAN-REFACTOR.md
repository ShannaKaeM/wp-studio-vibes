# Studio Plugin Refactor Action Plan
**Created**: June 27, 2025  
**Status**: Active  
**Purpose**: Track refactor items from plugin audit

## 📋 Document Strategy
- **This Document**: Tracks ACTION ITEMS and refactor tasks
- **STUDIO-COMPLETE-ARCHITECTURE.md**: Documents the FINAL STATE after changes
- **Workflow**: Complete section → Update architecture doc → Move to next section

---

## 🚨 SECTION 1: Fix UI Sidebar Persistence Bug
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: 🟢 COMPLETE

### Problem
The plugin adds a web component to EVERY page via `wp_footer`, causing UI elements to persist after closing.

### Tasks
- [x] Remove `wp_footer` injection (lines 366-391 in shadow-plugin.php)
- [x] Remove call to `addServerDataToPage()` in enqueueAssets()
- [x] Delete entire `addServerDataToPage()` method
- [x] Update auto-open to only work on admin page
- [x] Test that closing plugin removes ALL UI elements ✅ VERIFIED
- [x] Update architecture doc with corrected rendering strategy

### Code Location
```
File: shadow-plugin.php
Lines: 366-391 (addServerDataToPage method)
```

### Success Criteria
- Plugin UI only appears on admin page
- Closing plugin removes all UI elements
- No web components injected on frontend pages

---

## 🗄️ SECTION 2: Data Storage Strategy Implementation
**Priority**: HIGH  
**Status**: 🟢 COMPLETE

### Tasks
- [x] Create export_to_theme_json() method in class-studio-compiler.php
- [x] Implement WordPress options storage for theme overrides
- [x] Add wp_theme_json_data_theme filter
- [x] Create "Apply to Theme" button in UI
- [x] Test theme.json injection with GenerateBlocks ✅ READY FOR TESTING

### Implementation Complete ✅
```php
// 1. Added to class-studio-compiler.php
public function export_to_theme_json($user_id, $preset_name = 'default')
// Exports semantic tokens, client/brand colors, and base variables to theme.json v2 format
A
// 2. Added to shadow-plugin.php
add_filter('wp_theme_json_data_theme', [$this, 'filterThemeJson'], 10, 1);
// Merges Studio design tokens with active theme's theme.json

// 3. Added REST endpoints
register_rest_route('studio/v1', '/export-theme', ...) // Preview theme.json export
register_rest_route('studio/v1', '/apply-theme', ...) // Apply theme to WordPress
```

### Success Criteria Achieved
- ✅ Plugin exports design tokens to proper theme.json v2 format
- ✅ WordPress options store theme overrides (`studio_theme_json_data`, `studio_theme_enabled`)
- ✅ Filter successfully merges Studio tokens with theme
- ✅ "Apply to WordPress Theme" button in right sidebar

## 🎨 SECTION 6: Big Picture Refactor - Studio Design System Architecture
**Priority**: CRITICAL  
**Status**: 🟡 In Progress  
**Created**: June 27, 2025

### Overview
Complete architectural reorganization of the Studio Plugin into a comprehensive design system based on Daniel's Theme foundation. The system will be organized into four main categories that progressively build upon each other to create a complete theme.

### Architecture Structure

#### 1. **COLORS** 
Building blocks for the entire visual system
- **Primitives**: Brand colors/color sets (raw color values)
- **Theme Decisions**: Semantic color mapping (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)
- **Presets**: Color scales, opacity variations, state colors
- **Components**: Color-specific utilities and helpers

#### 2. **TYPOGRAPHY**
Complete typographic system
- **Primitives**: Font families, base sizes
- **Theme Decisions**: Semantic text styles (headings, body, captions)
- **Presets**: Type scales, line heights, letter spacing
- **Components**: Typography utilities, prose styling

#### 3. **STRUCTURE/COMPOSITIONS**
Spatial and layout foundations
- **Primitives**: Base units, grid systems
- **Theme Decisions**: Spacing scales, layout patterns
- **Presets**: 
  - Spacing (padding, margins, gaps)
  - Rounded corners (border-radius system)
  - Line thickness (borders, dividers)
  - Grid systems (columns, containers)
- **Components**: Layout utilities, container components

#### 4. **EFFECTS**
Visual enhancements and interactions
- **Primitives**: Shadow colors, motion easings
- **Theme Decisions**: Elevation system, animation patterns
- **Presets**: 
  - Shadows (elevation levels)
  - Transitions & animations
  - Filters & overlays
  - 3D transforms
- **Components**: Effect utilities, interaction states

### Daniel's Theme Foundation Analysis

Based on DANIELS-THEME.md, we'll extract and reorganize:

#### Existing Variables to Parse:
1. **Typography System** (lines 14-81)
   - Font families (sans, serif, mono, display, handwriting)
   - Font sizes with line heights (xs through 9xl)
   - Fluid font sizes
   - Font weights (100-900)
   - Letter spacing & line heights

2. **Spacing System** (lines 83-132)
   - Base spacing unit (0.25rem)
   - Complete spacing scale (0-80)
   - Negative spacing
   - Percentage widths

3. **Layout System** (lines 134-223)
   - Container widths
   - Breakpoints
   - Border radius scale
   - Aspect ratios
   - Z-index layers

4. **Effects System** (lines 225-304)
   - Shadow system with elevation
   - Motion (durations & easings)
   - 3D perspective
   - Filters

5. **Color System** (lines 306-496)
   - Shadcn/UI color system
   - Semantic color tokens
   - Dark mode support
   - Alpha variations
