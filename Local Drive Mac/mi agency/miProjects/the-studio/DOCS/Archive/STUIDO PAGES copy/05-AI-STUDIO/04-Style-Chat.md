# AI Studio - Style Chat

## What This Does
Provides a conversational interface for managing your design system. Like chatting with a design expert who knows your entire design system and can make changes through conversation.

## Simple Explanation
- Chat with your design system in plain language
- Ask questions about your design choices and get explanations
- Make changes by talking instead of clicking through interfaces
- Get design system insights through natural conversation

## Key Features
- **Natural Language Interface**: Talk to your design system like a person
- **Design System Queries**: Ask questions about your current settings
- **Conversational Editing**: Make changes through chat commands
- **Design Explanations**: Understand why your design system works the way it does

## What You Get
```javascript
// Example Style Chat conversations

// Querying your design system
User: "What's my primary color?"
AI: "Your primary color is a medium blue (oklch(56.9% 0.042 198.223)). 
     It's used for main action buttons, primary links, and focus states."

User: "Why does my hero text look so big?"
AI: "Your hero uses the 'display' text size (60px) from your 'dramatic' 
     typography preset. This creates strong visual hierarchy and 
     draws attention to your main message."

// Making changes through conversation
User: "Make my buttons more rounded"
AI: "I'll increase your button border radius from --radius-md to 
     --radius-lg. This gives buttons a more friendly, modern feel."

User: "My spacing feels too tight"
AI: "I'll switch your spacing preset from 'compact' to 'comfortable'. 
     This increases padding and margins throughout your design system."

User: "Can you make a dark theme version?"
AI: "I'll generate a dark theme using your existing colors. Your blue 
     primary will work well, but I'll lighten your text colors and 
     darken your backgrounds for proper contrast."

// Getting design insights
User: "Is my color contrast accessible?"
AI: "Your primary blue on white background has a 4.8:1 contrast ratio, 
     which meets WCAG AA standards. However, your secondary orange only 
     has 3.2:1 - I recommend darkening it slightly for better accessibility."

User: "How does my typography compare to industry standards?"
AI: "Your body text at 16px is perfect for readability. Your heading 
     hierarchy follows a good mathematical scale with clear size differences. 
     Consider increasing line height slightly for long-form content."
```
