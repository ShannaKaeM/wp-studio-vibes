// Example AI Assistant interactions

// Design consultation
User: "What colors work well with my primary blue?"
AI: "Based on your brand blue (oklch(56.9% 0.042 198.223)), I recommend:
     - Complementary: warm orange for CTAs
     - Analogous: teal and navy for variety
     - Neutral: warm grays to balance the cool blue"

// System optimization
User: "How can I improve my typography hierarchy?"
AI: "Your current scale has good contrast between display and title sizes,
     but I recommend increasing the body text size to 18px for better
     readability, especially on mobile devices."

// Component suggestions
